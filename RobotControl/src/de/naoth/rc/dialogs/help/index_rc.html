<h3>Macro (DebugCommand recording)</h3>
<p>When RC is connected to a robot, the menu item "Macros" is activated. There the recording of DebugCommands to the robot can be started. Only "set" commands are recorded (DebugRequests, Modules, Agent, Parameters).</p>
<p>Each recording is named and inserted as a new menu item in the "Macros" menu. If a recording is selected, all previously recorded DebugCommands are sent to the robot again. If necessary, dialogs must be updated to make the changes visible.</p>
<p>An entry can be deleted by holding down "CTRL" and selecting the entry to be deleted with the mouse.</p>
<p>The recordings are stored in the RC user directory as "cmd_recording_&lt;name&gt;.bin".</p>
