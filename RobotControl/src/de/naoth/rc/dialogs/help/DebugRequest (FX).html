<h2>DebugRequest (FX)</h2>
<p>
  This dialog shows a list of available debug requests for the currently 
  connected nao robot. Note that only DebugRequests are shown that reside in 
  currently active Modules. The hierarchy of the DebugRequests is defined by
  the prefixes of their names. The behavior of a DebugRequest is defined inside the corresponding module.
</p>

  <li><b>Quicksearch</b>: With focus on the debug request tree, a filter search can be activated by 
    simply typing characters to search for. A textfield is shown on the bottom

    containing the searched phrase (case insensitive).</li>
