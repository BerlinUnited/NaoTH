<h2>RemoteTeamControl</h2>

<p>
  The dialog listens to teamcomm and shows the robot in the same subnet. RobotControl can connect to one of the robots via button click. If a supported Gamepad is connected to the computer (e.g. XBox controller) the gamepad can be used to send commands to the robot. If the correct agent is running on the robot you can control the robot motion.
