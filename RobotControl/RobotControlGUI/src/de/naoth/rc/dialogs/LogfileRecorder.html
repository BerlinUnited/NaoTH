<h3>Logfile recorder</h3>

<p>
This dialog is used to record logfiles.
</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Important</b></font>:
Please mind that you can't use unlimited space on the robot.
When logging images you normally are not able to log more than one minute.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Even more important</b></font>:
The logfile will be saved on the robot to the <font color="#FF0000"><b>tmp</b></font>
directory by default. Thus, it will be <font color="#FF0000"><b>deleted</b></font>
when you restart or shutdown the robot. Therefore, be sure to have copied the
recorded logfile to you local storage before shutdown the robot :)
