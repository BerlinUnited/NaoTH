<h2>DebugRequestPanel</h2>
<p>
  This dialog shows a list of available debug requests for the currently 
  connected nao robot. Note that only DebugRequests are shown that reside in 
  currently active Modules. The hierarchy of the DebugRequests is defined by
  the prefixes of their names. The behavior of a DebugRequest is defined inside the corresponding module.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Update</b>: Updates the list of available DebugRequests. New modules that were activated after the last update are appended to the list.</li>
  <li><b>Reload</b>: Deletes the list of DebugRequest and reloads them again.</li>
</ul>
