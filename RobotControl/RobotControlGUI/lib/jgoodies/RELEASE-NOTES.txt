                          Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance update adds features useful for tweaking
    the text field selection on keyboard focus gain. The JGoodies
    Windows L&f now uses "Windows" as ID to comply with the
    LookAndFeel#getID specification.
    

NEW FEATURES

    o The feature that selects text field text on focus gain can now 
      be enabled or disabled globally, and it can be overridden
      per field. See Options#setSelectOnFocusGainEnabled(boolean) and
      #setSelectOnFocusGain(JTextField, Boolean). As before, the feature
      is enabled by default.
    o If the select on focus gain is enabled, the selection is from
      start to end by default. The selection bias can be configured
      as end to start using Options#INVERT_SELECTION_CLIENT_KEY.
      Useful if the field contains text that typically will be reentered
      and where the leading text is more important than the trail.
    o On focus lost the caret can be positioned at the start.
      See Options#SET_CARET_TO_START_ON_FOCUS_LOST_CLIENT_KEY.
      This is useful for short fields where the lead text shall
      be visible after focus lost, because it is more important
      than the trail.
      
    
BUG FIXES

    o The select on focus gain is applied only to editable fields.


OTHER CHANGES

    o JGoodies WindowsLookAndFeel#getID now returns "Windows"
      where it returned "JGoodies Windows" before.
    o Updated to the Forms 1.2.1.
    o Minor source code improvements.

                          Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This JGoodies Looks version 2.1 fixes bugs, comes with 
    a few improvements and adds micro layout customization.
    Version 2.1 is binary incompatible with previous versions.
    However the changes will affect only very few API users.
    
    The most visible changes are a new gray filter for icons, 
    new Plastic icons, Vista improvements, and that text is
    selected after keyboard focus changes.

    The micro layout API allows to customize the insets,
    margins, and gaps used in the components. The default
    micro layout aims to comply with the "Microsoft Layout 
    Specification and Guidelines". The default is used for 
    the JGoodies Windows L&f and the Plastic L&f family.
       Since most native Windows applications don't comply
    with the Windows style guide, you may wish to change
    the micro layout to be closer to a given native app,
    such as MS Office, MS Internet Explorer, etc. 
       From my perspective the micro layout specified in
    the Windows style guide is best for Windows, and it's
    good on other platforms. It aims to reduce visual noise
    by using consistent component sizes and text positions
    for all components that are arranged in a row. Therefore
    I recommend to use the default micro layout.
       A custom micro layout may be useful, if you design
    many large forms and vertical space is scarce. You can 
    then define smaller insets to gain more space.
    
	
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    o Removed the deprecated Options.IS_NARROW_KEY.
      Use Options#setUseNarrowButtons(boolean) instead.
    o Removed the deprecated Options.TEXT_AREA_INFO_BACKGROUND_KEY.
      We suggest to use a factory that vends JTextArea's 
      with the background set to the editable background instead.    
    o Removed the deprecated methods PlasticLookAndFeel#getMyCurrentTheme
      and PlasticLookAndFeel#setMyCurrentTheme. These have been replaced
      in the Looks 2.0 by #getPlasticTheme and #setPlasticTheme.
    o Key constants for setting a FontPolicy by name have been renamed
      to be consistent with the feature they describe, e.g.
      "Plastic.fontChoicePolicy" -> "Plastic.fontPolicy".
      This won't affect you if you use the API method
      xxxLookAndFeel#setFontPolicy or the key value from the
      Options class, for example Options.PLASTIC_FONT_POLICY_KEY
    

BUGS FIXED

    #088: SplitPaneDivider ignores the opaque property of the split pane.
    #111: RTL menus have problems with accelerator alignment.
    #128: Windows XP table header border is wrong.
    #131: Tabbed pane content is not properly centered in WinXP L&f.
    #150: Vista read-only combo renderer not transparent.
    #152: Vista read-only combo box lacks focus dashed rect.
    #???: NPE in ShadowPopup#hide
    
    
NEW FEATURES
    
    #087: Added a new gray filter for disabled icons in Java 5 and later.
          It can be enabled or disabled globally; it is on by default.
          The global setting can be overridden per component, see:
          Options.setHiResGrayFilterEnabled and the
          Options#HI_RES_DISABLED_ICON_CLIENT_KEY client property key.
    #116: Provide option to customize the component micro layout. 
    #117: Consider removing more combo box renderer borders. 
          Added the Options.COMBO_RENDERER_IS_BORDER_REMOVABLE hint
          for combo box renders that indicates whether a  border 
          can be temporarily removed when painting the current value. 
          This is useful for custom Windows combo renderers.
    #151: Select text field text after focus gained by keyboard.
          This is done in the Windows L&f, and can be enabled for Plastic, 
          see PlasticLookandFeel#setSelectTextOnKeyboardFocusGained.
          For Plastic this feature is enabled by default on Windows.


OTHER CHANGES

    #040: Consider improving instance reuse.
    #048: Add 3D icons for PlasticXP's tree collapse/expand.
    #093: Consider making PlasticXP spinner buttons round.
    #132: PlasticXP checkbox/radio button without text doesn't paint focus.
    #133: Consider making PlasticXP toolbar button rollover border round.
    
    o Plastic uses Tango icons, see www.tango-project.org.
    o Plastic option pane icon size honors the software resolution.

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release fixes a severe regression (issue #142)
    that affects the JGoodies Windows L&fs in classic Windows mode
    on Java 1.4/Java 1.5 where a window displays a JPasswordField. 
    It is strongly recommended to update your Looks library version.
    
    Also, the font choice in Chinese, Korean, and other non-western
    environments has been improved for the case where the Java env
    lacks the multi-language files.

    
BUGS FIXED

    #141: fonttest.jar manifest classpath broken.
    #142: Broken classic Windows password field in 1.4 and 1.5.
    #143: Broken font choice in non-western envs that lack i18n files


OTHER CHANGES

    o FontTest shows more detailed internationalization data.

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release fixes a regression, comes with improved
    support for the Windows Vista Beta2, and ships the Plastic themes 
    "Experience Royale" for XP's Royale style, and "Light Gray"
    for Vista's Aero style.

    
BUGS FIXED

    #130: Plastic internal frames paint wrong drop shadow. 
    #135: Fonts#getWindowsControlFont returns null on Vista Beta2.
    #136: NPE in DefaultPlasticOnWindowsPolicy on Vista Beta2.
    #137: Component height too small on Vista Beta2.
    #138: Add a color theme that mimics Vista's Aero default.


NEW FEATURES
    
    o Added the Plastic themes "Experience Royale" and "Light Gray".
    o Improved the mechanism that chooses the default Plastic theme
      to detect Luna Normal/Home Stead/Metallic, the MS Royale skin,
      and Vista's Aero. "Experience Royale" is the default on XP-Royale, 
      "Light Gray" is the default on Vista-Aero.


OTHER CHANGES

    o Distribution ships with a precompiled Font Test jar.
    o Removed the Palette2 from the Looks Demo desktop tab.
    o Minor cleanup in the build.xml and default.properties.

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release fixes a regression, a bug, and improves 
    the password field appearance in non-Windows environments.

    
BUGS FIXED

    #122: Regression: Missing popup menu drop shadows.
    #123: Windows popup menu may lack the selection background.
    #127: Spinner editor insets too large since Mustang b82. 


OTHER CHANGES

    o Marked Options.TEXT_AREA_INFO_BACKGROUND_KEY as deprecated.
      We suggest to use a factory that vends JTextArea's 
      with the background set to the editable background instead.
      You may use a text area that sets the background in #updateUI
      to ensure that it is refreshed on Look&Feel changes.
    o Combo box popup uses the combo box width as minimum,
      even if a popup prototype display value has been set.
    o The Windows and Plastic password fields now use the
      UIManager's echo character, share the password view,
      and this patch is used in Java 1.4 and Java 5 only.
    o The Looks Demo shows non-editable and disabled spinners.
    o Improved the selection background of non-editable
      Windows combo boxes that use a custom renderer.

                          Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This JGoodies Looks version 2.0 fixes bugs, comes with 
    many improvements and uses an overhauled font lookup.
    The contained Windows L&f and Plastic L&fs supercede 
    all previous version w.r.t. consistency, design precision, 
    and support for Java 5, Java 6 and Windows Vista.
    
    Version 2.0 is binary and visually incompatible with the
    Looks 1.x; however most API changes are simplifications and 
    the visual changes improve the consistency of your apps.
    
    The font lookup in the Windows L&f has been overhauled.
    Text component insets have been adjusted to better comply 
    with the "Microsoft Layout Specification and Guidelines".
    Also, Windows Vista is now supported: bounds, insets and 
    font baseline positions are consistent on the Vista betas.
    
    The Plastic L&f family component bounds and insets 
    have been adjusted to the new Windows bounds and insets.
    The Plastic font lookup has been completely overhauled; 
    it is great on Windows and works well on other platforms. 
    
    The new font customization mechanism allows you to change 
    the fonts per L&f, platform, locale and desktop settings.


CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE BINARY COMPATIBILITY

    The old font options (FontSizeHints, etc) have been replaced 
    by the new FontPolicy mechanism and predefined FontPolicies.

    o Replaced Options.CONTROL_FONT_KEY and MENU_FONT_KEY by:
      - PLASTIC_FONT_CHOICE_POLICY_KEY
      - PLASTIC_CONTROL_FONT_KEY    
      - PLASTIC_MENU_FONT_KEY    
      - WINDOWS_FONT_CHOICE_POLICY_KEY
      - WINDOWS_CONTROL_FONT_KEY    
      - WINDOWS_MENU_FONT_KEY    
    o Removed Options.EXT_WINDOWS_NAME
    o Removed Options.FONT_SIZE_HINTS_KEY
    o Removed Options#getGlobalFontSizeHints
    o Removed Options#setGlobalFontSizeHints
    o Removed PlasticLookAndFeel#getFontSizeHints
    o Removed PlasticLookAndFeel#setFontSizeHints
    o Removed WindowsLookAndFeel#getFontSizeHints
    o Removed WindowsLookAndFeel#setFontSizeHints
    o Removed FontSizeHints
    o Removed LookUtils#createButtonMargin(boolean)
    o Removed LookUtils#installNarrowMargin
    o Removed FontUtils
    o Options#initializeDefaultReplacements now private
    o Removed obsolete Plastic themes: SkyBluerTahoma, 
      ExperienceBlueDefaultFont, DesertBluerDefautFont
      
      
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE VISUAL COMPATIBILITY

    Options#getUseNarrowButtons returns true by default.
    Although the narrow margins are the correct button margins,
    it leads to poor design if you don't ensure a reasonable
    minimum width for buttons with a short text, e.g. "OK".
    You can disable this feature using #setUseNarrowButtons(false),
    which was the behavior in the JGoodies Looks 1.x.
    
    Options.DEFAULT_LOOK_NAME is now PLASTICXP_NAME
    making PlasticXP the default L&f when chosen via
    the Options L&f names. PLASTICXP_NAME is also returned
    by Options#getCrossPlatformLookAndFeelClassName.
      
    On Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/2003/XP the JGoodies Windows L&f 
    follows the "Microsoft Layout Specifications and Guidelines" 
    even closer than the JGoodies Windows L&f version 1.3.
    Components that are arranged in a row have perceived bounds 
    of 14 dialog units (dlu). Since Windows XP command buttons
    (in the default styles) have two transparent lines in 
    the top and bottom, the concrete command button bounds
    are 2 pixels larger than for the textfield, combo, etc.
    If you lay out them in a row and center them vertically 
    the perceived (aka visual) bounds will be aligned.
       On Windows Vista the JGoodies Windows L&f dimensions
    and insets are based on the "Windows Vista UX Guidelines" 
    version 0.8. The JGoodies sizes differ slightly from
    the sizes recommended by these guidelines. For example
    the guidelines recommend to make a text field on 96dpi
    with normal fonts 20px tall, a combo 21px and buttons 22px
    (or 13dlu). The JGoodies Windows L&f uses consistent sizes, 
    insets and font baseline positions for all components
    that are arranged in a row - just as recommended in all 
    previous Windows editions, but based on 13dlu because 
    the new default font Segoe UI is significantly taller.
    
    The default font chosen on Windows now honors the desktop 
    font setting (Normal/Large/Extra Large) if supported 
    by the Windows version, Windows language, and Java renderer.
    Microsoft recommends to use the desktop setting "font size"
    to get larger fonts, many applications ignore it and 
    just scale with the software resolution (96dpi/120dpi).
       On 96dpi the new font doesn't differ from the 
    font chosen by the Looks 1.x; it's Tahoma 8pt on modern
    Windows, and Segoe UI 9pt on Vista. On 120dpi the new font 
    is 1px taller than the font used by the Looks 1.x. 
    
    The Plastic L&f family uses Windows fonts on Windows
    and logical fonts on all other platforms. In the Looks 1.x
    most Plastic themes used the Tahoma font on all platforms.
    If Tahoma was absent, the logical fonts were used.

      
VISUAL BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

    We recommend to use the new default settings and it is 
    strongly recommended to use the new font lookup on Windows. 
    However, here's how you can get the appearance of 
    the Looks 1.x. The configurations listed below
    must be performed before you install a look&feel.
    
    To get the wrong wide button margins, call:
      Options.setNarrowMargins(false).
      
    To use the Looks 1.x fonts in the Windows L&f use:
      WindowsLookAndFeel.setFontPolicy(
          FontPolicies.getLooks1xWindowsPolicy());
          
    To use the Looks 1.x fonts in the Plastic L&fs use:
      PlasticLookAndFeel.setFontPolicy(
          FontPolicies.getLooks1xPlasticPolicy());
          
    To give Plastic the new fonts on Windows and the
    Looks 1.x fonts on other platforms use:
      PlasticLookAndFeel.setFontPolicy(
          FontPolicies.getTransitionalPlasticPolicy());
          
    You can customize the control font and menu font
    in the system properties for Windows and Plastic:
    java -jar -DWindows.controlFont="Tahoma-plain-11"
              -DWindows.menuFont="Tahoma-plain-12"
              -DPlastic.controlFont="Tahoma-plain-11"
              -DPlastic.menuFont="Verdana-bold-12"
        myapplication.jar
    If the menu font is not specified, the control font
    will be used for menus too.

KNOWN ISSUES

    Plastic 3D effect broken on Mac OS X Tiger with Java 1.4 and 5.
    Due to a bug in the Tiger Java2D implementation, the pseudo 3D
    up and down effects are not rendered. Instead a plain white
    is painted. See also issue #92.
    

NEW FEATURES
    
    #55: Add option to make combo popups wider than the combo.
         You can set a popup prototype display value that
         is used to determine with popup widths.
         
    o Narrow buttons can be disabled in the system properties.
    o Added a JPopupMenu client property for no-margin borders,
      see Options#NO_MARGIN_KEY. This is useful if a JPopupMenu 
      contains a single component, for example a JScrollPane.
    o Added a JTextArea client property for an info background.
      This hint is used for non-editable areas that shall use
      the editable background, not the inactive background.


DISTRIBUTION CHANGES

    o Merged the source folders 'src/common', 'src/plastic'
      and 'src/windows' to 'src/core'.
    o The sources no longer ship as a source Zip archive.
      They now come in the directory structure used by the CVS. 
      This makes it easier to build the distribution using ANT.     
      If you want to attach the library sources in an IDE, 
      point to folder 'src/core'.
    
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o The Windows and Plastic L&fs have been tweaked for Windows Vista.
    o Overhauled the Windows combobox layout and rendering.
    o Overhauled the Plastic combobox layout and rendering.
    o Improved appearance of the Looks Demo tabs on Windows.
    o The ANT build can now create a Maven bundle.
    o The demo's DemoFrame class accepts a parameter for the L&f: 
      "Windows", "Plastic", "Plastic3D", "PlasticXP",
      or a full class name like:
      "com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows.WindowsLookAndFeel",
      "javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel".
