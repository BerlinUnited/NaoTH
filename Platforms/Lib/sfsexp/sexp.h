/**
 * \mainpage A small and quick S-expression parsing library.
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * 
 * This library was created to provide s-expression parsing and manipulation
 * facilities to C and C++ programs.  The primary goals were speed and
 * efficiency - low memory impact, and the highest speed we could achieve in
 * parsing.  Suprisingly, no other libraries on the net were found that were
 * not bloated with features or involved embedding a full-fledged LISP or
 * Scheme interpreter into our programs.  So, this library evolved to fill
 * this gap.  As such, it does not guarantee that every valid LISP
 * expression is parseable, and many features that are not required aren't
 * implemented.  See Rivest's S-expression library for an example of a much
 * more featureful library.
 *
 * What features does this library include?  At the heart of the code is a
 * continuation-based parser implementing a basic parser state machine.
 * Continuations allow users to accumulate multiple streams of characters,
 * and parse each stream simultaneously.  A continuation allows the parser
 * to stop midstream, start working on a new expression, and return to the
 * first without corruption of complex state management in the users code.
 * No threads, no forking, nothing more than a data structure that must be
 * passed in and captured as data becomes available to parse.  Once an
 * expression has been parsed, a simple structure is returned that
 * represents the "abstract syntax tree" of the parsed expression.  For the
 * majority of users, the parser and this data structure will be all that
 * they will ever need to see.  For convenience reasons, other functions
 * such as I/O wrappers and AST traversal routines have been included, but
 * they are not required if users don't wish to use them.

/**
 * An s-expression is represented as a linked structure of elements,
 * where each element is either an <I>atom</I> or <I>list</I>.  An
 * atom corresponds to a string, while a list corresponds to an
 * s-expression.  The following grammar represents our definition of
 * an s-expression:<P>
 *
 * <pre>
 * sexpr  ::= ( sx )
 * sx     ::= atom sxtail | sexpr sxtail | 'sexpr sxtail | 'atom sxtail | NULL
 * sxtail ::= sx | NULL
 * atom   ::= quoted | value
 * quoted ::= "ws_string"
 * value  ::= nws_string
 * </pre>
 * <P>
 *
 * An atom can either be a quoted string, which is a string containing
 * whitespace (possibly) surrounded by double quotes, or a non-whitespace
 * string that does not require surrounding quotes.  An element representing
 * an atom will have a type of <i>value</i> and data stored in the <i>val</i>
 * field.  An element of type <i>list</i> represents an s-expression
 * corresponding to <i>sexpr</i> in the grammar, and will have a pointer to
 * the head of the appropriate s-expression.  Details regarding these fields
 * and their values given with the fields themselves.  Notice that a single
 * quote can appear directly before an s-expression or atom, similar to the
 * use in LISP.

 * return all s-expressions at once without knowing how many there are in
 * advance (this would require more memory management than we want...).
 * So, by using a continuation-based parser, we can call it with this string
 * and have it return a continuation when it has parsed the first

 * through the <i>last_sexpr</i> field of the continuation), we can call
 * the parser again with the same string and continuation, and it will be
 * able to pick up where it left off.<P>
 *
 * We use continuations instead of a state-ful parser to allow multiple
 * concurrent strings to be parsed by simply maintaining a set of
 * continuations.  Manipulating continuations by hand is required if the
 * continuation-based parser is called directly.  This is <b>not
 * recommended</b> unless you are willing to deal with potential errors and
 * are willing to learn exactly how the continuation relates to the
 * internals of the parser.  A simpler approach is to use either the
 * <i>parse_sexp</i> function that simply returns an s-expression without
 * exposing the continuations, or the <i>iparse_sexp</i> function that
 * allows iteratively popping one s-expression at a time from a string
