#
# This skript specifies the rules of the RoboCup Standard Platform League (2017) [regarding the ball position]
#
# The world.py skript uses these rules to check ball positions and/or to move
# the ball according to the given rules
#
#############

#############
#
# in general the ball is represented as two dimensional vector (x,y) with real value entries
# the field center point represents the position (0,0), the coordinate origin
#
# we refer to the player who's goal is at the end of the field with negative x - coordinates as player 1
# and to the other player as player 2
#
#############


#############
#
# rules:
#  * if the the ball went trough one of the goals referring to a player we grant the opposite player a point and reset
#    the ball position to (0,0)
#  * if the ball is in the field, nothing gets changed
#  * if the ball crosses sidelines of the field the ball position gets manipulated as follows:
#      - Done: read rules and encode as formulars
#
#############

#############
#
# technicalities:
#  goal:
#   to calculate goal situations we need at least the last 2 ball position to generate a line, from which we can derive
#   the ball trajectory from which we can conclude weather the ball is got went trough the goal
