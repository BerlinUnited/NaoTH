If the robot doesn't receive any generated messages, make sure you have set the correct network (broadcast address)!
E.g. »-n 10.0.255.255«

To start the script, use (for example) the following command:
	./main.py -n 10.0.255.255 -p 10004

To set the initial values of the send `teammessage` data, one can modify the "config.py" file.

To set/modify the `teammessage` data 'online', use the "set" command:
	set playerNumber 4

There's also a help available.
