# Unreal Enginge Tools
Tools for dealing with data generated by an unreal engine simulation created by the Bembelbots team

The have two different repos:  
- https://github.com/TimmHess/UERoboCup
- https://github.com/Bembelbots/UERoboCup

The dev Branch in the first repo is newest one that works. This one was used to create the
image data at `/vol/repl261-vol4/naoth/logs/Experiments/2020-UnrealGeneratedImages`

## Changes to the Python Code
- made the script python3 compatible
- save images iteratively to disk, instead of loading everything to memory first

## How to run the patch extraction:
run `python extract_patches.py` to extract patches from the images inside the data directory

## TODO:
- create segmentation masks that cvat can understand
- more useful segmentation values
-
