createConvolutionCode.m generates a cpp file which calculates a convolution for ball.png with a predefined filter

TODO
- describe where trainingsdata can be found
- explain how training can be done in matlab

- which layer still need implementing

- Issues with convolution layer export
	-> introduce matlabOffset as variable
	-> implement stride as parameter which defines the dimensions of the output matrix
