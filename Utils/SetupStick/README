Parts of the setup stick system are:

../NaoConfigFiles/etc/udev/rules.d/brainwashing.rules
../NaoConfigFiles/brainwashinit
startBrainwashing.sh

Functionality:
At the moment the os recognizes a usb stick, the udev rule brainwashing.rules (located in /etc/udev/rules.d) is activated and the script brainwashinit (located in /usr/bin) will be executed.
brainwashinit mounts the stick and execute the script startBrainwashing.sh which must be on the stick.
startBrainwashing.sh makes a backup of the old naoth executable and the old Config and copies the new naoth executable and the new Config folder (plus a sound file to Media). After execution the stick will be unmounted and the sound file is played which indicates a successful process.

Stick structure:

/startBrainwashing.sh
/home/nao/bin/naoth
/home/nao/naoqi/Config/* [all config stuff]
/anDieArbeit.wav
