libb64: Base64 Encoding/Decoding Routines
Modified for SimSpark (http://simspark.sourceforge.net)
======================================

Overview:
--------
libb64 is a library of ANSI C routines for fast encoding/decoding data into and
from a base64-encoded format.
Please visit http://libb64.sourceforge.net/ for more information.

Why modify?
----------------
We use base64 to en/decode image data inside the program,
so we use the library without stream.
